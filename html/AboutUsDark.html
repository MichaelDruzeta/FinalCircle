      <p class="titleFaq">Frequently Asked <b>Questions</b></p>

      <div class="faqQ">What is an intranet?</div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          Intranet means a closed network that resides on a local network. An
          intranet acts like a website that only authorized users can access and
          is generally used by organizations who wish to share knowledge,
          internal communications, and information with their colleagues.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">
        What is the difference between the internet and an intranet?
      </div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          The main difference between an intranet and the internet is that the
          former is a closed network, and the latter is a public network. In
          short, the internet is for all; a company intranet is for a select
          group of people.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">What is an intranet and an extranet?</div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          An intranet is a closed network designed to allow an organization to
          share information and corporate communication among its employees. An
          extranet is similar to an intranet, but allows third-party entry, so
          vendors or partners can experience full or selected access.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">What are intranet sites?</div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          Intranet sites are closed internal networks for authorized members of
          an organization to share information. They act as a company news
          channel, an internal communications tool, and a collaboration tool.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">What are intranet applications?</div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          Intranet applications are software within an intranet like document
          publishing, communication tools, broadcasts, etc. These applications
          allow the user to do a range of activities, for example: publish a
          blog, connect with a colleague, or run employee surveys.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">What is an intranet portal?</div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          An intranet portal is the access point to the user’s company intranet.
          It is on the intranet portal where the user can access intranet
          applications as well as external apps, and information and knowledge
          that is stored within the intranet itself.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">Can an intranet work without the internet?</div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          Former on-premise company intranets could operate without internet.
          But for a wide range of reasons, the majority of company intranet
          applications are now cloud-based, so an internet connection is
          necessary.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">Can an intranet be accessed remotely?</div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          Yes, an intranet can be accessed on a range of devices, regardless of
          location – all that is required is an internet connection. This is
          ideal for any organization with dispersed or front-line employees who
          need communication tools and access to organizational information
          wherever they are.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">What does an intranet do?</div>
      <div class="faqA">
        <p class="faqAtxt">
          Offering all types of organizational solutions, intranet software can
          improve employee engagement, aid communication, and increase
          collaboration. Modern intranets are now mostly cloud-based which
          allows global organizations to connect, share knowledge, and broadcast
          news quickly.
